# TODO rules
# No one under 36 inches may ever ride, either by themselves or with another rider.
# Normally, two riders sit in the car together. 
# A single rider can only ride if they are at least 18 years old and are at least 62 inches tall.
# If there are two riders and one of them is at least 18 years old, they may ride together.

# # TODO Streach ****
# If there are two riders, but neither one is at least 18 years old, 
# they may still ride as long as they are both at least 12 years old and at least 52 inches tall.

# If a person is age 12â€“17, ask if that person has a golden passport.
# If they do, they should be treated as if they were 18 years old for the sake of all rules.
# (Don't forget to apply this to the single rider case.)

# If there are two riders, but neither one is at least 18 years old,
# they may still ride if one rider is at least 16 years old and the other is at least 14.
# (Keep in mind that the first rider may be the younger of the two or they may be the older of the two.)
